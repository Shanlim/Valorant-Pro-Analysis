## Who were the most valuable players of the tournament?



## What were the performance metrics of the most valuable players?
The Value Player Rating (VPR) was created based on insights from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QCR19qYPgI).

### How was the VPR created
The VPR is a composite metric designed to evaluate a player's overall impact on the game. It incorporates several key performance metrics that indicate how much value a player contributes through their performance.

The formula used for calculating VPR is as follows:

[ VPR = (KPR * 0.8) + (APR * 0.5) + (Clutch % * 0.25) + (FKFD * 0.2) + (KAST % * 0.4) ]

### Explanation of Variables

1. **KPR (Average Kills Per Round)**:
   - **Importance**: High kill rates are essential for securing rounds and maintaining map control. Kills directly influence the outcome of each round by reducing the opposing team's ability to fight back.
   - **Justification**: Weighted at 0.8 to emphasize the direct impact of kills on the game while maintaining a balance with other performance metrics. Kills are crucial for individual player impact but should not overshadow the importance of teamwork and other contributions.

2. **APR (Average Assists Per Round)**:
   - **Importance**: Assists indicate teamwork and the ability to contribute to kills even without landing the final shot. Assists often reflect a player's support role and their contribution to team play.
   - **Justification**: Weighted at 0.4 as assists are important but secondary to kills in terms of individual impact. This weight ensures that assists are valued for their role in team dynamics but are not overly emphasized compared to direct eliminations.

3. **CL_percentage (Clutch Percentage)**:
   - **Importance**: Clutch plays often turn the tide of a round, showcasing a player's ability to perform under pressure.
   - **Justification**: Weighted at 0.25 since clutch moments, while impactful, occur less frequently and should be balanced with consistent performance metrics.

4. **FKFD (First Kill First Death Ratio)**:
   - **Importance**: Securing the first kill in a round provides a significant advantage, while minimizing early deaths reduces the team's risk.
   - **Justification**: Weighted at 0.2 to reflect its importance in gaining early-round advantages without overshadowing other metrics.

5. **KAST_percentage (Kills, Assists, Survived, and Traded Percentage)**:
   - **Importance**: A comprehensive metric indicating overall effectiveness in multiple aspects of play.
   - **Justification**: Weighted at 0.4 as it combines several critical factors of player performance, providing a holistic view of their impact on the game.
