## What were the performance metrics of the most valuable players?
The Value Player Rating (VPR) was created based on insights from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QCR19qYPgI).

### How was the VPR created
The VPR is a composite metric designed to evaluate a player's overall impact on the game. It incorporates several key performance indicators that indicate how much value a player contributes through their performance.

The formula used for calculating VPR is as follows:
\[ VPR = (APR \times 0.5) + (CL\_percentage \times 0.25) + (FKPR \times 0.2) + (KAST\_percentage \times 0.4) \]

### Explanation of Variables
1. **APR (Average Assists Per Round)**: This metric measures the average number of assists a player achieves per round. Assists are crucial as they indicate a player's contribution to their team's success beyond just securing kills.

2. **CL_percentage (Clutch Percentage)**: This represents the percentage of rounds in which the player was involved in a clutch situation and succeeded. A clutch situation is typically defined as a scenario where the player is the last one alive and must win the round for their team.

3. **FKPR (First Kill Per Round)**: This metric tracks the average number of first kills a player secures per round. First kills are highly valuable as they can provide a significant early advantage to the player's team.

4. **KAST_percentage (Kills, Assists, Survived, and Traded Percentage)**: This composite metric measures the percentage of rounds in which the player had a positive impact through kills, assists, surviving the round, or being traded (i.e., an opponent killed them, but a teammate immediately avenged their death).
